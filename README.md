2022: ...




You need a reality check! Reality starts from the inside and makes its way out.

Push yourself because no-one else is going to do it for you.

What comes easy won’t last, what lasts won’t come easy.

It always seems impossible until it’s done

Don’t limit your challenges, challenge your limits!
