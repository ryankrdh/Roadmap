QUESTIONS:  

1) BIG-O: Logarithmic complexity and binary searches.

2) BIG-O: pg. 46 Example 3.

3) Why sorting is O(N log N)
https://theartofmachinery.com/2019/01/05/sorting_is_nlogn.html

4) BIG-O: pg. 49 Example 9.
5) BIG-O: pg. 52 Example 12.

6) String compression. Should I be using .append and .join? (string builder)

7) pg 98. #3.1 Three in One. Fixed Division or flexible division?

8) def sum_func(n):

    # base case
    if len(n) == 1:
        return n

    else:
        return n % 10 + sum_func(n//10) # make sure this is doing classic division

sum_func(4321)
